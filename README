sharpSAT version 1.1

To compile this version of sharpSAT simply run

make

Note that this only works, if you have gmp installed. sharpSAT uses GMP to store the model counting results with infinite precision.

If you do not want to use infinite precsision numbers in sharpSAT you simply have to use
Makefile_nogmp instead of the standard Makefile.
