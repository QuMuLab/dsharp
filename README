DSHARP version 1.0

If you would like the solver to use infinite precision numbers for the counting,
you must have the GMP library (libgmp-dev) installed. To use the version with GMP,
copy the Makefile_gmp to Makefile. Otherwise, copy Makefile_nogmp to Makefile and
proceed normally.

To compile this version of DSHARP simply run
make
